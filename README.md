# General-RTOS
This version of the RTOS's library is a generic one. It contains the tools that an RTOS needs, but it isn't specific to a type of microcontroller. Therefore, this library can't be downloaded and used. The user needs to implement key elements that will depend on its microcontroller like the timers.
