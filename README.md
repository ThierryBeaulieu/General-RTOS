# General-RTOS

## The Goal of This Project
This is a library created to make an RTOS that could be personalised for different types of microcontroller. The goal of this library is to create a structure that would resemble the one of an RTOS by incorporating key options that would normally be present in an RTOS.

## How to use it
If you wish to use an RTOS for a microcontroller, you can simply download this repo and use the library as a framework for the development of your firmware. At the current time, the RTOS is used C++ libraries uses some smart pointers. This could potentially be an issue for the users that wants to use the avr-gcc compiler.
