# General-RTOS
This is a library created to make an RTOS that could be personalised for different types of microcontroller. The goal of this library is to create a structure that would resemble the one of an RTOS by incorporating key concepts that would normally be present in an RTOS.

If you wish to use an RTOS for a microcontroller, this library will give you a basic structure that you could adapt according to your needs. Therefore, since that the project doesn't depend on the installation of the library on a microcontroller, you can run the project with a Makefile or on your IDE by creating a new project.
