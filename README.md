# General-RTOS
This version of the RTOS's library is a generic one. It contains the tools that an RTOS needs, but it isn't specific to a type of microcontroller. Therefore, this library can't be downloaded and used. The user needs to implement key elements that will depend on its microcontroller like the timers.

Therefore, since that the project doesn't depend on the installation of the library on the microcontroller, you can run the project with a Makefile or on your IDE by creating a new project.
