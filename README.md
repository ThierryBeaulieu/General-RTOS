# General-RTOS

Hi there, welcome to grtos, a general run time operating system library.

This is a library created to make an RTOS that could be personalised for different types of microcontroller. The goal of this library is to create a structure that would resemble the one of an RTOS by incorporating key options that would normally be present in an RTOS. The project itself is made to be used as a template, but you could simply incorporate grots the same way to you would incorporate a library to your CMake project.

## Installation
The first thing that you will want to do is to copy this repo! To do that, you can use this command line:
```bat
git clone https://github.com/ThierryBeaulieu/General-RTOS.git
```
The first thing that you should know of is that this library depends on [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/). Therefore, you should make sure to have it installed. Once that this is done, you should be good to go!
